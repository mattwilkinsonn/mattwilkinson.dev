Last week I started a new job at Google as a Software Engineer in NYC!

I'm very excited to join such a great company. I'm also joining the Google Sheets team, and I've personally used Sheets for all sorts of things (as many others have), so I'm also excited to work on a product I've used and I know is important to millions of people around the world.

I'm thankful for my professors at AU, my previous colleagues at Roku, and my friends and family for their guidance, mentorship, and support over the past few years.

I hope to write some more updates here on my work at Google (I need to learn a new language on top of all of the Google-specific technology), but there's obviously some restrictions around that, so updates there might be slow. However I will be writing more about my various open source contributions, including to [wasmCloud](https://wasmcloud.com/)!
